        As a profession, a nurse’s journey can be just as arduous as those undertaken by doctors. They are the ones who spend the most time with the patients, both as their advocates and caregivers. They will take blood samples, temperatures, talk to patients and answer all potential questions they might have. They are usually the first ones on the scene and are an integral part of the hospital team.

        Public safety is a noble calling. Service, justice and fundamental fairness must be the foundation of every police action. Police officers always have to be prepared and expect the unexpected. They have to be mentally, emotionally and physically ready to serve and protect the citizens against untoward perpetrators, very often putting their own lives on the line in order to ensure the safety of the public.
